# python nctogtiff.py in.nc out.tif
# Convert a GOES-16 netCDF's Rad (radiance) field to a geotiff.

# This is a fairly weird/opinionated script. Big gotchas:
#
# 1. We use both the netCDF library and rasterio, even through
#    we could make do with either one alone. netCDF reads out
#    the data much faster (bypassing GDALâ€™s driver, which is
#    very slow on GOES-16 netCDF files, I *think* because of
#    an interaction between how it's compressed and the fact
#    that it's south-up). Rasterio, on the other hand, is useful
#    because it reads the georeferencing tags in a convenient
#    form, letting us skip an explicit conversion from the way
#    the netCDF stores it (which I would not trust myself to
#    implement robustly anyway).
#
# 2. The scaleup_factor is just an arbitrary number that seems
#    to scale real-world radiance values well into the uint16
#    valid data range. It might lead to quantization for a
#    file with very small values, or overflow for one with very
#    large values. So watch out, especially outside the visible.
#
# 3. We do a little dance to read the data out upside-down.
#    Output is south-up (but correctly georeferenced, so it
#    easily reprojects to north-up). Ideally (TODO), we would
#    write a north-up TIFF with a flipped transform.
